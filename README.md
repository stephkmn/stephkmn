## Hello world! ✨
I'm Stephanie, a Computer Science student currently based in the US.

I like to build stuff to learn and improve my skills.
This is where I upload all my projects.

🗨️ I am currently working on a Pokemon VGC team builder chatbot, an AI chatbot that suggests strong teams according to the current meta and format, taking into account the user's input and suggestions.
